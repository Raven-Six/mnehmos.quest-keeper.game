|-------------|-------------|
| Describe what your character does | Narrates the world and story |

| Ask questions | Handles dice rolls and rules |
| Have fun! | Creates challenges and rewards |

## 💬 What to Say

**Good examples:**
- "I search the room for hidden doors"
- "I ask the bartender about the rumors"
- "I attack the goblin with my sword"
- "I try to sneak past the guards"

**The DM handles everything else:**
- Rolling dice
- Calculating damage
- Tracking inventory
- Managing combat turns

---

## ⚔️ During Combat

1. **Wait** for the DM to say it's your turn
2. **Describe** your action: "I swing at the orc!"
3. **The DM** rolls dice and narrates the result
4. **Repeat** until combat ends

> 💡 The DM controls all enemies automatically—you just focus on YOUR character!

## 🎯 Pro Tips

- **Stay in character** for more immersive roleplay
- **Ask questions** about anything you don't understand
- **Try creative solutions**—the DM rewards clever thinking
- **Take notes** on NPC names and important info
- **Experiment** with skills, spells, and items
